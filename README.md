# number_generation

## About
Experimenting with my neural network library, [puffpastry](https://github.com/uek-1/puffpastry), to generate mnist numbers.

## Results
So far, the results are not very good. There is a lot of noise caused by the loss function performing badly with empty images.

### With target class: 2
